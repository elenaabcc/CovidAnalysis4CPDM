Each presentation will discuss:
- The scope and goals of the study;
- The results obtained and the observation made;
- The final thesis substantiated by the data, together with some explanatory
hypothesis.

Each group should decide:
- The phenomenon to study. There is no predefined choice, you can analyze anything
you find interesting. The goal is to study the effect of the vaccination on the spread of
the virus and other aspect of the real world or, vice-versa, if and how parameters of
the real world (either practical, political or physical) affect the vaccination;
- Which data sources, in addition to the data from ECDC, to use. How to integrate
them together, which action should be taken to make them compatible and
comparable;
- Which kind of statistical analysis to perform and which kind of visualization to adopt
to explain the data.
